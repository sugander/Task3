Project Title: Correlation Analysis of Installs, Ratings, and Reviews for Recently Updated Apps on Google Play Store

Project Overview: This project aims to generate a heatmap that visualizes the correlation matrix between installs, ratings, and review counts for apps updated within the last year. The analysis incorporates specific filtering criteria to ensure only relevant apps are considered:

Key Filters Applied:

    Installs: Include only apps with at least 100,000 installs.
    Review Counts: Only include apps with more than 1,000 reviews.
    Update Timeframe: Consider apps that have been updated within the last year.
    Genres: Exclude apps from genres whose names start with the letters A, F, E, G, I, or K.

Additional Condition:

    The graph should be generated and displayed only between 3 PM to 6 PM.

Deliverables:

    A heatmap visualizing the correlation matrix between:
        Installs
        Ratings
        Review Counts

This project provides an in-depth understanding of how installs, ratings, and reviews correlate for high-performing, recently updated apps while adhering to strict filter criteria.
